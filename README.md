🗨Small Java ChatApp
Welcome to the Small Java ChatApp, where Java meets real-time conversation! Whether you're looking to chat with friends or dive into networking concepts, this lightweight console-based app is the perfect starting point.

"Great things happen when we connect!" – Anonymous

✨ What's Inside?
💬 Real-time Messaging: Instant messaging with anyone connected to the server.
🔄 Server-Client Architecture: The server seamlessly handles multiple clients through multithreading.
📡 Private Conversations: Communicate directly with specific users in private messages.
🚀 Lightweight & Fast: No fancy UI, just pure console magic for smooth, distraction-free chatting.

##🎯 How It Works
Imagine you're in a virtual chat room! The Server is like the room’s host, welcoming guests (clients) and making sure everyone can talk to each other without chaos.

Server: Runs in the background, ready to connect to as many chatters as you want.
Clients: Each user opens a client window and joins the conversation.
🚦 Communication Flow
Server listens for incoming connections.
Each new client is handled in a separate thread, so no one gets left out.
Messages sent by one user are broadcast to everyone connected, unless it's a private whisper! 👂
🛠️ Setup Guide
Getting started is as easy as sending a message! Here's how:
